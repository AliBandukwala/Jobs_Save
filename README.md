# Getting Started with Jobs App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Installation

You can simply pull the repo, run "npm install" and then "npm start" to run the app on the browser.

# Tech-Stack used

This app is created using React and Material UI with react-toastify package for toast messages.

# How to use the app

- The app demonstrates the basic use of Toasts for showing short messages for short amount of time (6 sec. by default). 
- App has a list of different jobs, and when a user clicks on the save icon on the right of each job, app will show a "Success" Toast notifying user about the success of saving a job. 
- The app also demonstrates the "Error" and "Warning" variants of the Toast. When the user clicks on the saved icon to un-save the job, the app will show an "Error" or "Warning" variant of the Toast (based on the variant property hardcoded in the jobs_list) notifying the user that operation of un-saving the job and its result.
